# TestCrate

![TestCrate Logo](docs/images/testcrate.webp)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This project is currently under active development. Features, APIs, and documentation may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

A modern, cloud-native test reporting and management platform built for the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem. TestCrate provides a comprehensive API for storing, organizing, and exporting test results with support for hierarchical builds, Allure integration, and multiple export formats.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Project Management**: Organize test results by projects with configurable categories
- **Hierarchical Builds**: Support for parent-child build relationships with nested test execution
- **Test Artifacts Storage**: Store and manage test results, containers, and attachments
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier authentication system (user, agent, admin)
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitor build stages (scheduled, running, finished, interrupted)

### Export & Reporting
- **Allure Integration**: Export test results in Allure format for rich HTML reports
- **Markdown Reports**: Generate human-readable markdown reports for build results
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Support for various output formats including tar archives
- **Build Hierarchy Visualization**: Export nested build structures with full context

### Technical Features
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Built for edge computing with global distribution
- **D1 Database**: SQLite-compatible database for reliable data persistence
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with Zod schema validation
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive REST API with automatic request validation
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Modular design with separate packages for core, server, and database layers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

TestCrate follows a modular monorepo architecture:

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Core business logic and schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-d1/        # D1 database implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-d1/    # Database utilities and migrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/         # Cloudflare Workers server
```

### Key Components

- **Controllers**: Handle business logic for projects, builds, attachments, and stored items
- **Export Controllers**: Generate reports in Allure and Markdown formats
- **Database Layer**: D1-compatible database operations with migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions
- **Schema Validation**: Zod-powered request/response validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20.18.0
- Yarn 4.9.2
- Cloudflare account (for deployment)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd testcrate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file
   cp packages/server/.dev.vars.example packages/server/.dev.vars

   # Edit .dev.vars with your API keys
   # USER_API_KEY=your-user-api-key
   # ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-api-key
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   cd packages/server
   yarn dev
   ```

### Available Scripts

- `yarn build` - Build the CLI and all packages
- `yarn test` - Run tests across all packages
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn start` - Start the CLI

### Database Setup

TestCrate uses Cloudflare D1 for data persistence. The database schema is managed through migrations:

```bash
# View migration status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8787/api/private/migrations/status

# Apply pending migrations (automatic on deployment)
```
